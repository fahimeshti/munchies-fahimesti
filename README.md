# Munchies
---

Here is my munchies project that I built with the following technologies-
- NextJS
- Redux toolkit
- RTK Query for optimized API calls
- API calling using Axios
- **typescript**
- TailwindCSS

## Features
1. User can see all products on the first page
2. Implemented add to cart feature [shows error if user tries to add more than the quantity_available]
3. Created a checkout page and order can be placed from the cart page.
4. All the orders can be seen on the `/orders` page which can be accessed from the top navigation icons.
